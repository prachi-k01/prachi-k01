## ðŸŒŸ Hi, Iâ€™m Prachi!

Iâ€™m a data and business analyst with a passion for turning messy data into meaningful, actionable insights. Iâ€™ve recently wrapped up my MSc in Management at the University of Birmingham, where I honed my skills in digital business, analytics, and operations management.

With over 2 years of experience (including my time at Capgemini as a Senior Analyst and now diving deep as a Business Analyst Intern), Iâ€™ve worked on everything from building data-driven APIs and crafting dashboards to predicting churn and analyzing corporate e-learning KPIs. Whether itâ€™s SQL, Python, Tableau, or Excelâ€”Iâ€™m all about using the right tools to drive decisions that matter.

ðŸ’» Skills I bring to the table:

SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Tableau, Power BI, Excel

Data Cleaning, EDA, Forecasting, Dashboarding

Business Storytelling & Stakeholder Engagement

Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me reading, traveling, or deep into Insta reels (guilty!). Iâ€™m always up for connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, sharing insights, or brainstorming the next big idea.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on making data not just informative but impactful!
