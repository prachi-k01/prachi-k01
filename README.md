## ðŸŒŸ Hi, Iâ€™m Prachi!

Iâ€™m a Business Analyst with a strong foundation in analytics and a passion for solving complex business challenges. At Capgemini, I worked as a Senior Analyst where I collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements, design data-driven solutions, and deliver actionable insights that supported strategic initiatives.

From building dashboards and analyzing corporate e-learning KPIs to predicting customer churn and developing API-based reporting solutions, Iâ€™ve helped teams make smarter, faster decisions. With expertise in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel, I thrive on translating business needs into clear, data-backed recommendations that drive results.

ðŸ’» Skills I bring to the table:

SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Tableau, Power BI, Excel

Data Cleaning, EDA, Forecasting, Dashboarding

Business Storytelling & Stakeholder Engagement

Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me reading, traveling, or deep into Insta reels (guilty!). Iâ€™m always up for connecting with fellow data enthusiasts, sharing insights, or brainstorming the next big idea.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on making data not just informative but impactful!
